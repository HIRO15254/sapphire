- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Details

### Content Quality Review
✓ **No implementation details**: The specification describes WHAT users need (OAuth2 authentication, session tracking) without mentioning specific technologies, frameworks, or APIs.
✓ **User value focused**: All requirements and user stories focus on poker player needs, data security, and tracking outcomes.
✓ **Non-technical language**: Written in plain language accessible to non-developers.
✓ **All sections complete**: User Scenarios, Requirements, and Success Criteria sections are fully populated with authentication and session tracking features.

### Requirement Completeness Review
✓ **No clarifications needed**: All requirements are specific and complete. OAuth2 authentication method has been confirmed (Google and GitHub).
✓ **Testable requirements**: Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-031) can be verified through testing.
✓ **Measurable success criteria**: All success criteria (SC-001 through SC-014) have specific metrics (time, percentages, counts, isolation guarantees).
✓ **Technology-agnostic criteria**: Success criteria focus on user-facing outcomes (OAuth sign-in time, data isolation, performance) not technical implementation.
✓ **Acceptance scenarios defined**: Each user story (P0-P4) includes Given-When-Then scenarios.
✓ **Edge cases identified**: 14 edge cases documented covering authentication failures, authorization, validation, data handling, and empty states.
✓ **Clear scope**: Five prioritized user stories (P0-P4) clearly define feature boundaries with authentication as the foundation.
✓ **No external dependencies**: OAuth2 providers (Google/GitHub) are standard services, not custom integrations.

### Feature Readiness Review
✓ **Clear acceptance criteria**: Functional requirements are paired with acceptance scenarios in user stories.
✓ **Primary flows covered**: P0 (authentication) and P1 (session recording) user stories cover core authentication and MVP functionality.
✓ **Measurable outcomes**: Success criteria define authentication time, data isolation, accuracy, performance, and usability metrics.
✓ **Implementation-free**: No leakage of technical decisions into the specification. OAuth2 is described as a standard, not a specific library.

## Notes

All checklist items passed after clarification. The specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`.

**Key Strengths**:
- Authentication-first approach ensures multi-user data isolation (P0)
- Well-prioritized user stories with clear MVP definition (P1 after authentication)
- Comprehensive functional requirements (31 FRs covering authentication, authorization, session management, statistics, filtering, validation)
- Strong success criteria with specific, measurable targets including security guarantees
- Excellent edge case coverage for authentication failures, authorization, and data validation scenarios

**Authentication Decision**:
- User selected OAuth2 providers (Google and GitHub) over email/password authentication
- This eliminates password management complexity and improves security
- No password recovery flow needed (handled by OAuth providers)

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation design artifacts.
