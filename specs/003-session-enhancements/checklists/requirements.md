# Specification Quality Checklist: ポーカーセッション記録機能の改善

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality Review
- ✓ Spec uses user-facing language (モーダルウィンドウ, セッション記録, etc.)
- ✓ No framework/library mentions (Mantine, tiptap mentioned only in user input, not in spec)
- ✓ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) completed

### Requirement Completeness Review
- ✓ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in spec
- ✓ All requirements testable (FR-001 through FR-019 have clear acceptance criteria)
- ✓ Success criteria measurable (SC-001 through SC-010 have quantifiable metrics)
- ✓ Edge cases comprehensively identified (8 scenarios covering security, performance, data integrity)

### Feature Readiness Review
- ✓ Each user story has detailed acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format
- ✓ User stories prioritized (P1-P4) for independent testing
- ✓ Success criteria align with user stories and functional requirements
- ✓ No technical implementation details (databases, APIs, code structure) in spec

## Overall Status

**PASSED** - All checklist items validated successfully. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
